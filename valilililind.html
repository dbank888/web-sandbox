			<h1>Dennis valilililind</h1>
			<p class="overview">What can I say, Mr. valilililind had a fine mustache - world class. There are rumours that he still has one even to this day. Though nothing can match the density and overall shape of the valilililind mustache from the 80's. Paired with a whimsical hair style, and an equally whimsical personality, any man in this world would be proud to be called Mr. valilililind.</p>
